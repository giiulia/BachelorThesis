# Single detectors characterization
The same analysis was conducted for all the appointed silicon detectors.
- Leakage current and electrical capacity are noteworthy features for a semiconductor detector. [I<sub>s</sub> and C<sub>det</sub>](/Single_detectors/Detector2/Is_Ceq) values were measured at **various power supply voltages**. [Data](/Single_detectors/Detector2/Is_Ceq/Data) are stored in txt files. To visualize the trends I used ROOT CERN libraries [TGraphErrors](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTGraphErrors.html) and [TCanvas](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTCanvas.html), the [Graphs](/Single_detectors/Detector2/Is_Ceq/Graphs) obtained are displayed as PDFs.
- Resolution performance is affected by the setting of reding chain parameters, such as the [shaping time](/Single_detectors/Detector2/Shaping_time) of the signal and the power supply ([V<sub>bias</sub>](/Single_detectors/Detector2/Vbias)). For this reason the energy spectrum was acquired with different electronic setup to identify the **optimized energy resolution**.
