# Near and faraway configurations

For the purpose of determining the most convenient **detector-source distance** for spectroscopy measures, performances of Detector1 were analyzed in two opposite geometric configurations within the spatial limits of the chamber:
- [near source](Near_source),
- [faraway source](Faraway_source).

Less distance from the detector has been shown to induce greater fluctuations in the energy lost in the dead layer of the detector due to the widening of the solid angle of trajectories incident on the detector. 
Therefore it was convenient to place the source as far away from the detector as possible.
