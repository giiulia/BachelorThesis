# Detector1+2
- The expected outcome of operating two detectors in parallel in the same reading chain is to measure the double of leakage current and capacity, wich lead to an increase of electrical noise in the circuit.
- Resolution performaces are negatively affected by the increase of electrical noise, as shown in the [Data](Detectors1+2/Shaping_time/Data) for the pulser resolution taken at different shaping times, or more directly in the [Graphs](Detectors1+2/Shaping_time/Graphs), as opposed to the values reached for individual detectors.
  
Thus, it can be inferred that a separate readout system  for each detector will be required for the operation of this customized chamber.
