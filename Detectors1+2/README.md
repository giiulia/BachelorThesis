# Detector1+2
- The expected outcome of operating two detectors in parallel in the same reading chain is to measure the **double** of [leakage current and capacity](Detectors1+2/Is_Ceq), wich leads to an increase of electrical noise in the circuit, as demonstrated by the [data](Detectors1+2/Is_Ceq/Data).
- Resolution performaces are negatively affected by the increase of **electrical noise**, as shown in the [data](Detectors1+2/Shaping_time/Data) for the pulse generator resolution taken at different shaping times, as opposed to the values reached for [single detectors](../Single_detectors).
  
Thus, it can be deduced that a separate readout system for each detector will be required for the operation of this customized chamber.
