# Radio simulations
The original purpose of running the simulations was to determine the most suitable depth of the detector's active layer to reproduce the spectrum shape of the beta+alpha decay. A rough range of depths between 200 &mu;m and 350 &mu;m was considered based on the capacity measures of the detector in use.\
Results of the initial attempt of reproducing the real interaction are shown in [radio_total_spectrum.pdf](Radio_source/Radio_simulations/Graphs/radio_total_spectrum.pdf).
