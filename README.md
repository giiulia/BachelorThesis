This work contributed to the developement of a custom vacuum chaber for high sensitivity alpha spectroscopy measures. The project was initiated by the section of INFN at Milan Bicocca. The process is well described in the [summary](Thesis_summary.pdf) provided both in italian and english.
My activity was focused on the characterization of 3 out of the 4 silicon surface barrier detectors destined to be allocated in the chamber. Each detector has been studied thoroughly by measuring both leakage current and electric capacitance in typical conditions of use and by determining its best point of work in terms of energectic resolution.
I tested the outcome of the system operating two of the detectors in parallel in the same reading chain and verified the values for current, capacity and energetic resolution obtained were consistent with expectations.
The execution of Monte Carlo simulations in C++ supported the hypotesis that considered the larger detector-source distance the better for spectroscopy measures by allowing the evaluation of energy loss in the detector's dead layer.
Spectroscopy measures of a 224Ra source were profoundly interesting for my study of characterization since the chain of the beta decay 212Bi->212Po with the alpha decay 212Po->208Pb generates a continous spectrum whose shape is determined by the depth of the active layer of the detector in use.
