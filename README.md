# BachelorThesis
This work contributed to the developement of a custom vacuum chaber for high sensitivity **alpha spectroscopy** measures. The project was initiated by the section of INFN at Milan Bicocca. The process is well described in the [summary](Thesis_summary.pdf) provided both in italian and english.\\

My activity was focused on the characterization of 3 out of the 4 **silicon surface barrier detectors** destined to be allocated in the chamber. \\
I tested the outcome of the system operating two of the detectors in parallel in the same reading chain.\\
The hypotesis that the larger detector-source distance is better for spectroscopy measures was supported by the execution of Monte Carlo simulations in C++.\\
Spectroscopy measures of a 224Ra source were profoundly interesting for my study of characterization for determining the depth of the active layer of the detector in use.
